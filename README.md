# The App
The live site is hosted on Heroku. Because I'm using the free tier plan it may take up to 30 seconds for the app to load. You may find it here: https://tranquil-taiga-56801.herokuapp.com/

## The Goal

It's a deep dive into building a MVP of a Twitter application. Instead of using scaffolding I built all models, views, and controllers on my own. Instead of using Devise I rolled my own authentication system for the purposes of learning. I've also followed TDD principles to write tests to lead development. 

## Feedback?
